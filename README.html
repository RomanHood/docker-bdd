<h1>Behavior-Driven Docker Development</h1>
<h2>Pre-Requisites - Docker &amp; Fig</h2>
<h3>Running Docker natively</h3>
<p>This is the preferred approach. If you're running linux natively then just install <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="http://www.fig.sh/">Fig</a> natively.</p>
<h3>Running Docker on Boot2Docker (OSX)</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/">Boot2Docker</a> and then install <a href="http://www.fig.sh/install.html">Fig</a></p>
<h3>Running via Vagrant and Virtualbox</h3>
<p>If you're on Windows, or can't get docker installed on your platform, we've provided a Vagrant setup that you can use. Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox &gt;= 4.3.20</a> as well as <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant &gt;= 1.6.5</a> for your platform. Then get up and running:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant up
$ vagrant provision
</code></pre>
<p>Once up and running, you'll run the fig commands from inside the vagrant image:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre>
<h3>Testing Dependencies</h3>
<p>In addition to installing docker and fig, you'll need to have <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> installed in order to run the tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>install ruby (e.g. via <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a> or a system package)</li>
<li>install cucumber
        gem install cucumber</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the Tests</h2>
<p>The tests ensure that the fig cluster is running, so running them is as simple as running <code>cucumber</code>. You can also just run a specific test:</p>
<pre><code>$ cucumber features/web.feature
</code></pre>
<h2>Starting the cluster</h2>
<p>Running the tests also accomplishes this, but if you're too lazy to run the tests:
    $ fig run -d</p>
<h2>When you make a change and want to rebuild a docker container</h2>
<p>Again, running the tests accomplishes this, but if you want to do it manually:
    $ fig build</p>
